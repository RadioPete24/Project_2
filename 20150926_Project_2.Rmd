For each year, the table contains number of tons of PM2.5 emitted from a specific type of source for the entire year.
    fips: A five-digit number (represented as a string) indicating the U.S. county
    SCC: The name of the source as indicated by a digit string (see source code classification table)
    Pollutant: A string indicating the pollutant
    Emissions: Amount of PM2.5 emitted, in tons
    type: The type of source (point, non-point, on-road, or non-road)
    year: The year of emissions recorded

# The overall goal of this assignment is to explore the National Emissions Inventory database and see what it say about fine particulate matter pollution in the United states over the 10-year period 1999–2008. You may use any R package you want to support your analysis.
# Questions

# You must address the following questions and tasks in your exploratory analysis. For each question/task you will need to make a single plot. Unless specified, you can use any plotting system in R to make your plot.
```

(1) Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the United States from 1999 to 2008? Using the base plotting system, make a plot showing the total PM2.5 emission from all sources for each of the years 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008.

```{r, message = F, warning = F}
yrEmissTot <- aggregate(Emissions ~ year, FUN = sum, data = NEI)
barplot(
          (yrEmissTot$Emissions)/10^6,
           names.arg = yrEmissTot$year,
           xlab = "Year",
           ylab = expression(PM[2.5]*~Emissions~" ("*10^"6"*" Tons)" ),
           main = "Plot 1: Total Yearly Emissions from PM[2.5]
          in the United States from 1999-2008"
) 

# Doing it in ggplot
Q1 <- function(){
                  ggplot(yrEmissTot, aes(x = as.factor(year), y = Emissions/(10^6))) + 
                  ggtitle('Plot1: Total Yearly PM[2.5]\nEmission in the United States from 1999-2008') +
                  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
                  xlab("Year") +
                  ylab(expression(PM[2.5]*~Emissions~" ("*10^"6"*" Tons)" ))
                  dev.copy(png, file = "plot1.png", width = 480, height = 480)
                  dev.off()
                  cat("Plot1.png has been saved in", getwd())
                  }
Q1()
```

(2) Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the Baltimore City, Maryland (fips == "24510") from 1999 to 2008? Use the base plotting system to make a plot answering this question.
```{r, message = F, warning = F}

bMore_NEI <- filter(NEI, fips == "24510")
yrEmissTot_bMore <- aggregate(Emissions ~ year, FUN = sum, data = bMore_NEI)

barplot(
        yrEmissTot_bMore$Emissions/(10^2),
        names.arg=yrEmissTot_bMore$year,
        xlab = "Year",
        ylab = expression(PM[2.5]*~Emissions~" ("*10^"2"*" Tons)" ),
        main="Plot 2: Total Yearly PM2.5 Emissions 
        in Baltimore City, Maryland from 1999-2008"
)

# Doing it in ggplot
Q2 <- function(){
                  ggplot(yrEmissTot_bMore, aes(x = as.factor(year), y = Emissions/(10^2))) + 
                  ggtitle('Plot 2: Total Yearly PM[2.5] Emissions 
                          in the United States from 1999-2008') +
                  geom_bar(aes(fill = year), stat = "identity") +
                  xlab("Year") +
                  ylab(expression(PM[2.5]*~Emissions~" ("*10^"2"*" Tons)" )) +
                  guides(fill = FALSE)
                  dev.copy(png, file = "plot2.png", width = 480, height = 480)
                  dev.off()
                  cat("Plot2.png has been saved in", getwd())
                  }
Q2()

# In general, total emissions from PM2.5 have decreased in Baltimore from 1999 to 2008.
```

(3) Of the four types of sources indicated by the type (point, nonpoint, onroad, nonroad) variable, which of these four sources have seen decreases in emissions from 1999–2008 for Baltimore City? Which have seen increases in emissions from 1999–2008? Use the ggplot2 plotting system to make a plot answer this question.
```{r, message = F, warning = F}
#from Baltimore data, facet_grid type
Q3 <- function(){
                  ggplot(bMore_NEI, aes(as.factor(year), Emissions, fill = type)) +
                  ggtitle(expression(paste("Plot 3: Total PM"[2.5]*" Emissions by Type in Baltimore City from 1999-2008"))) +
                  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
                  facet_grid(. ~ type, scales = "free", space="free") + 
                  xlab("year") +
                  ylab(expression(paste("PM"[2.5]*" Emission (Tons)"))) +

                  guides(fill = FALSE)
                  dev.copy(png, file ="plot3.png", width = 480, height = 480)
                  dev.off()
                  cat("Plot3.png has been saved in", getwd())
}
Q3()

# Emissions from the 'non-road', 'nonpoint', 'on-road' types have decreased  whereas emissions from the 'point' type increased from 1999-2008 in Baltimore, MD. The 'point' type, however, did observe a decrease in emission after the 2005 year.

```

```{r, message = F, warning = F}

# Subset coal combustion related NEI data
# Brief data description: EI.Sector - sector, level 1 - equipment, level 2-purpose, level 3 - material used, level 4 - material produced
